| 8/22 - Update team.html links to team member pages; replaced bootstrap buttons with a bootstrap navbar; added some comments
|
| I added all of the individual pages to a folder called member_pages. From now on, the link from the team page to an individual page should be in
| the format of '/member_pages/page.html' instead of 'page.html'. To link from an individual page to the team page, have the link be '/team.html'.
| I also removed all of the ugly bootstrap buttons without much formatting and replaced them with a navbar, which makes navigating between pages much
| easier. If you want to add this to your page, just copy and paste the nav element below and update the href links.

| 8/30 - PHP database
|
| I set up the database. Just run any of the webpages and change the url to "https://good-scratch-sethmaxwl.c9users.io/phpmyadmin/"
| We need to set a password; as of now anyone on the workspace can go in (current username is "sethmaxwl" password is blank)

| 9/8 - mdbootstrap design
|
| I added the mdbootstrap design to the code editor page, but it broke the embedded console. I tried to troubleshoot the console, but I haven't gotten anywhere
| so far. I also added a landing page which is fully optimized with mdbootstrap and looks pretty nice if I do say so myself. I've started working on the layout
| for the login page. So far, I have two forms on the page: one for logging in and one for signing up. The login requires an email and password. The sign up requires
| an email, a password, and a password reentry. The layout isn't finished just yet, but it's coming along.
